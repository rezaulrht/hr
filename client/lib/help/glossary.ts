  posting:
    "Turning one business event — a payroll approval, a bill — into its entry in the ledger. A posting is never edited later; it is corrected by reversing it.",
  journal:
    "One entry in the ledger, made up of lines. Every line names an account and an amount on one side, debit or credit.",
  ledger:
    "The full record of every entry the company has made. Reports read the ledger; nothing is ever typed twice.",
  "trial balance":
    "Every account at once, with its debits and credits side by side. When the two totals agree, the books are square and statements can be produced.",
  debit:
    "The left side of an entry — money going into an asset or expense account, or out of a liability or income account.",
  credit:
    "The right side of an entry — money going into a liability, income or equity account, or out of an asset or expense account.",
  "contra account":
    "An account that reduces another account instead of holding money of its own. Accumulated depreciation is the classic one: it sits beside the asset's cost so the net figure shows what the asset is worth.",
  "written-down value":
    "What a fixed asset is worth on the books: what it cost, less the depreciation charged to date.",
  "reducing balance":
    "A way of depreciating: each year a fixed percentage of what is left, rather than a fixed amount of the original cost. The charge gets smaller as the asset ages.",
  reversal:
    "A second entry that undoes a posted one. Both stay on the record — nothing is ever deleted from the ledger.",
  "retained earnings":
    "The accumulated profit or loss the company has kept rather than paid out. The year-end entry sweeps each year's result into it.",
  "opening balance":
    "What an account held at the start of the period it is being read for. On the first year, these are entered by hand; after that they come from the ledger.",
  "financial year":
    "The twelve months the accounts are reported over — for this company, 1 July to 30 June.",
  "accounting period":
    "One of the twelve months inside a financial year. Entries land in the period their date falls in, and a closed period accepts no new ones.",
  comparative:
    "Last year's figure, shown beside this year's so a movement is visible without looking anything up.",
  reconciliation:
    "Checking one record against another — the bank book against the bank statement, or the cash-flow total against the balance sheet — and explaining the difference.",
  "working capital":
    "What the company has available to run on: what customers owe it, plus cash, less what it owes suppliers and staff.",
