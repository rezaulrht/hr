/**
 * The app-wide 404.
 *
 * `app/not-found.tsx` catches two different things: an unmatched URL anywhere
 * in the app, and any `notFound()` thrown inside a route segment. Both land
 * here, which is why the copy names the address rather than the feature — it
 * cannot know which page the reader was aiming for.
 *
 * Built on shadcn's `Empty`, the registry's own primitive for this shape.
 * There is no 404 block in the shadcn registry; `Empty` is what it gives you,
 * and it arrives in the `base-nova` style the rest of the app is drawn in.
 *
 * Motion is this project's `.rise-in` from globals.css rather than a
 * `tw-animate-css` utility: it already carries the reduced-motion fallback
 * (the fade survives, the movement goes) instead of needing `motion-reduce:`
 * on every element. Delays step by 40-60ms — long enough to read as a
 * cascade, short enough that the last element is in place inside 300ms, so
 * nobody waits on the buttons.
