/**
 * The split screen every signed-out page sits in.
 *
 * This was inline in the login page until password reset needed it too. The
 * reasoning that put the brand panel there applies harder on the reset
 * screens: a sign-in is something you went looking for, while a reset link is
 * opened from an email, cold, often on a phone, and the panel is the only
 * thing on the page that says which system is being changed.
 *
 * Only the right-hand column varies. The panel's own copy is about byteSpate
 * rather than about the form beside it, so it stays fixed here instead of
 * becoming three near-identical props.
