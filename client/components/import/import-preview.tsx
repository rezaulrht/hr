 * one issue shape for every consumer. This is the client side of that: the
 * asset and cost wizards had byte-identical copies of the row-union logic and
 * near-identical issue cells, which had already drifted — one showed a green
 * check for a clean row and the other a grey dash, so the same file reviewed
 * in two places looked like two different verdicts.
 *
 * A third consumer (historical expenses) is on the roadmap, which is what
 * makes this worth naming rather than copying a third time.
