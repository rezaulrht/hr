/**
 * The "4 — compass — 4" cluster, and the one piece of delight on this page.
 *
 * Why animate at all: a 404 is *rare*. The frequency test that kills animation
 * on a command palette (hundreds of opens a day) licenses it here — nobody
 * sees this often enough to grow tired of it. It is also the only honest
 * subject for motion on the page: a compass hunting for a bearing is what
 * being at the wrong address feels like.
 *
 * Physics rather than a keyframe, for two reasons. A spring keeps velocity
 * when its target moves, so a needle chasing the cursor never restarts from
 * zero the way a retriggered keyframe would. And the entrance is the same
 * mechanism as the tracking: the needle simply *starts* three-quarters of a
 * turn out and settles, so there is no separate intro animation to keep in
 * sync with the interactive one.
 *
 * Hand-rolled because no motion library is installed, and pulling one in for
 * a single page nobody should be visiting is the wrong trade.
