/**
 * A profile photo at the size it deserves — the thumbnail everywhere else is
 * sized for a list or a header, not for actually looking at someone's face.
 *
 * Sizing rule that matters: every constraint on the image is in VIEWPORT
 * units, never a percentage of its parent. The parent shrink-wraps the image
 * (`w-auto`), so a percentage width here would be circular — the browser
 * resolves that by falling back to the file's intrinsic pixel size, which
 * overflows the dialog and turns the base `overflow-y-auto` into scrollbars.
 * That is exactly the bug this replaces.
 *
 * `object-contain` with a free aspect ratio, not a square crop: a portrait ID
 * photo cropped to a square loses the top of the head, which defeats the
 * point of opening it.

          card, and two of them are subtler than they look:

          `overflow-y-visible` is spelled out because tailwind-merge treats
          `overflow` and `overflow-y` as separate groups, so a bare
          `overflow-visible` leaves the base `overflow-y-auto` standing.

          The base `max-h-[85svh]` is deliberately NOT fought. `max-h-none`
          does not displace an arbitrary value in tailwind-merge, so both
          would ship and stylesheet order would decide the winner. Instead
          the image below caps itself at 82svh, comfortably under the
          container's 85svh, so the limit never engages and there is nothing
          to override. */}
