/**
 * Search and filters for a list of records.
 *
 * Every list page in this app renders its whole result set at once. That is
 * fine for the endpoints as written, since each returns the full set in one
 * response, but it means the only way to find one row among two hundred is to
 * read all two hundred. Filtering happens here, on data already in memory: no
 * request, no debounce, no loading state to design around.
 *
 * The count is not decoration. Once a filter is on, the difference between
 * "nobody matches" and "the list failed to load" is the only thing the reader
 * needs, and a bare empty table says neither.
