/**
 * Everything that has happened, as far as the reader is entitled to see it.
 *
 * This route used to render a `SubpageData` mock: five invented reports owned
 * by four people who do not work here, under a stat reading "Data freshness:
 * Live · Synced 4 min ago" describing a sync that does not exist. Two real
 * "View all" links on the dashboard pointed straight into it, so genuine
 * activity led to fabricated activity.
 *
 * `GET /api/events` is real, scoped server-side, and already feeds the
 * notification bell. Scheduled reporting is not built — `server/src/modules/
 * reporting/` holds a .gitkeep and nothing else — so this page does not
