/**
 * Brings a live database's **reference data** up to date with the code.
 *
 * The gap this closes: `prisma db seed` runs once, by hand, when a database
 * is created. The release phase runs `prisma migrate deploy` and nothing
 * else. So a chart account, posting rule or category added to a seed file
 * *after* a database was first seeded reaches that database by no route at
 * all — it simply stays missing, and the first symptom is a posting failing,
 * or worse, quietly resolving through a wildcard to the wrong account.
 *
 * That is exactly what happened to `SETTLEMENT_ACCRUAL/ASSET_RECOVERY`,
 * `PAYROLL_ACCRUAL/DEDUCTION:ASSET_RECOVERY` and `ASSET_DISPOSAL/BANK`.
 *
 * **Safe to run against production, repeatedly.** Every seeder below is
 * idempotent on a natural key and leaves existing rows alone, so a re-run
 * fills in what is missing and changes nothing a human has since edited.
 *
 * **Deliberately not the whole seed.** `prisma/seed.ts` also creates demo
 * admin users and announcements; the announcements are `create`d rather than
 * upserted and would duplicate on every run, and the users would have their
 * passwords reset. Those are fixtures, not reference data, and they are not
 * called here.
 *
 * Order matters: posting rules resolve account codes against the chart, and
 * now throw rather than skipping silently if one is absent.
