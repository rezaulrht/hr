/**
 * Closing the days nobody punched out of.
 *
 * A day left open blocks payroll — the row stays PENDING and preflight counts
 * it — so an unclosed Monday quietly holds up the whole month until somebody
 * notices. Before this, the only remedy was the employee spotting it or HR
 * chasing, and the one mechanism built for it (the 09:30 email nudge) posts
 * into `heroku logs`, because no SMTP is configured.
 *
 * So the day is closed at the shift's end time and **the guess is labelled**:
 * `autoCheckOutAt` is set, `AUTO_CHECK_OUT` replaces `MISSING_CHECKOUT` in the
 * approver's queue, an audit row records it, and the employee is told the next
 * morning. The record stays PENDING, so an assumed time still cannot reach a
 * payroll run without a person approving it.
 *
 * It errs low on purpose. Somebody who worked until 21:00 and forgot is
 * recorded as leaving at 18:00; with no overtime feature those hours are not
 * payable anyway, and under-crediting is the safe direction for a number
 * nobody witnessed.
