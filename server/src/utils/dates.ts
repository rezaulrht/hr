/**
 * Generic date-only arithmetic, shared across modules.
 *
 * A "date-only" value is a calendar date pinned to UTC midnight, never an
 * instant — so two dates compare exactly, and a date the user picked never
 * shifts by one because the server's locale differs from theirs.
 *
 * Only the arithmetic lives here. Policy stays with the module that owns it:
 * leave's weekly-off day and backdating window are in `leave.dates.ts`, and
 * attendance's office timezone is in `attendance.time.ts`.
