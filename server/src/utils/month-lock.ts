/**
 * The payroll month lock.
 *
 * A month with an APPROVED or DISBURSED PayrollRun is closed. Anything that
 * would change what that month's payroll *should* have paid must refuse,
 * because the money has already been decided — and in the DISBURSED case,
 * already left the building.
 *
 * Lives in `src/utils` rather than in the payroll module because leave and
 * attendance both call it. Leave importing from
 * `../attendance/attendance.holidays` for a payroll rule would be the wrong
 * dependency in two directions at once.
 *
 * Four call sites: holiday writes and leave approval (both wired here),
 * payroll adjustments, and exit-detail edits (each wired with the code that
 * needs them).
