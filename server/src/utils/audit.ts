/**
 * The shared change log.
 *
 * Polymorphic `entity` + `entityId` rather than one typed audit table per
 * module, because the read pattern is always "what happened to this thing"
 * or "what happened this month", and neither wants a join.
 *
 * Called inside the same transaction as the change it records — a write that
 * succeeds without its audit row is a bug, matching `attendance.audit.ts`.
 *
 * Distinct from the event log: this is one row per *record*, `emitEvent` is
 * one row per *user action*. Bulk-approving a fortnight for sixteen people is
 * 160 audit rows and one event.
