/**
 * "This month's payroll", shared by the Super Admin and Finance cards.
 *
 * One implementation rather than two, because the interesting rule here is
 * the same for both and is easy to get wrong: **a month with no run reads
 * "Not started", never "৳0"**. Zero is a claim that payroll ran and came to
 * nothing, which is a different — and much worse — fact than nobody having
 * opened it yet.
