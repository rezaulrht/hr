/**
 * Who decides on an attendance record.
 *
 * **Every record is decided by a named human.** There is no auto-approval
 * path, deliberately: a web punch proves identity and server time, nothing
 * about whether the person was actually at work. The only thing that makes
 * the record trustworthy is a manager or HR who *saw* them confirming it, so
 * removing the human removes the entire control.
 *
 * Filtering on "does this record look unusual" was tried and removed. It
 * fails in the specific way that matters: a punch faked from home produces a
 * flawless record — on time, full hours — and would sail through unseen,
 * while an honest colleague who arrived seven minutes late got scrutinised.
 * Anomaly-shaped filtering is inversely correlated with the risk it is meant
 * to catch.
 *
 * `exceptionsFor` survives that removal and is still used, but only to
 * *label* rows in the approval queue — it directs the approver's attention
 * within a list they must work through regardless. It never decides
 * anything.
