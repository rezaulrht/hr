/**
 * The second guard, and the one `assertLedgerBalanced` structurally cannot

 *
 * A trial balance is flat, so it agrees whatever shape the tree is in. The
 * statements are not: each total is a descent from a roled group, or from the
 * equity root. An account that no descent reaches contributes to no total —
 * its balance simply is not in the document, while the trial balance it was
 * checked against still ties. Then `Assets = Liabilities + Equity + Profit`
 * stops holding, and the design treats that as an identity rather than a
 * check, so nothing downstream notices.
 *
 * Three ways an account gets there, none of them exotic:
 *   - a cycle in `parentId`, which detaches a whole loop from every root
 *   - an account created directly under `1000 Assets` rather than under
 *     `1100` or `1200`, so it is under a root but under no *section*
 *   - a re-parent that moves a subtree out from under its roled group
 *
 * Note the entry points are not "the roots". Reachability from a root is a
 * weaker property and would pass the second case above.
 *
 * The error names the accounts, because "the balance sheet does not balance"
 * sends someone hunting through journals, and "1300 Widget Deposits is not
 * under any statement section" is a two-minute fix in the chart.
