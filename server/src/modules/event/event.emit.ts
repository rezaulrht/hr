/**
 * Writing to the event log.
 *
 * `emitEvent` takes a transaction client and never the global `prisma`,
 * matching `auditPayroll` and `auditAttendance` — it is called inside the
 * same transaction as the change it records, so an announcement can never
 * outlive a rolled-back write.
 *
 * There is no Prisma middleware and no automatic emission anywhere: every
 * event is an explicit call in a service, because only the calling code
 * knows whether one user action touched one record or a hundred.
