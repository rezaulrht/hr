 * and makes "who was on the list" a question about a job that ran, rather
 * than about the rule that was true.
 *
 * **There is no unfiltered list function**, not even an internal one. The
 * filter is not a parameter that can be omitted, because a read that forgets
 * it leaks a leave rejection to the whole company and looks exactly like a

 * absent: `actorUserId` is mandatory in exactly the way `visibleToFilter` is.
 *
 * The audience clause is deliberately **not** ANDed on. Two reasons:
 *
 * Safety first — a row recording that you did something cannot disclose
 * anything you did not already see when you did it. The scope is inherently
 * self-referential, which no audience rule can loosen.
 *
 * And correctness — emitting code targets an audience of people who need
 * *telling*, which frequently excludes the person who acted. A Super Admin
 * approving a payroll run is not in that event's target roles, so an actor
 * filter ANDed with the audience would return a convincing empty list.
 *
 * `notYetPublished` is omitted for the same reason: an announcement you
 * scheduled yourself is your own action, and holding it back until its
 * publish time would hide your work from you.
