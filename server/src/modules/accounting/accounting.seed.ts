/**
 * The starter chart of accounts.
 *
 * This is a transcription of the company's audited FY 2024-25 financial
 * statements (G. Nabi & Co., Chartered Accountants, 22 January 2026), not a
 * generic textbook chart. Every group below is a line in the filed accounts
 * and every leaf is a row in one of their notes — the `note` field records
 * which. That is what will let slice 2 produce a document the auditor can
 * tie to their own working papers instead of one they have to re-key.
 *
 * Four things here a generic chart would not have:
 *
 * - `1120 Accumulated Depreciation` is a contra-asset group: type ASSET, but
 *   it normally carries a *credit*, and the Balance Sheet's single
 *   "Property, Plant & Equipment 126,350" line is PPE_COST − PPE_ACCUM_DEP.
 * - The P&L splits expenses four ways, not two, which is what makes a Gross
 *   Profit line derivable at all.
 * - Salary appears twice, 5122 under Direct Expenses and 5201 under
 *   Administrative. Which one a given salary lands in is a slice 3 mapping
 *   question, and it is why JournalLine.departmentId exists.
 * - `3200 Share Money Deposit` is a distinct equity account from Share
 *   Capital; it is a named column in their Statement of Changes in Equity.
 *
 * Reference data, not demo data — the same posture as the seed-slimming
 * work. Idempotent on `code`, so re-running never duplicates and never
 * overwrites a name somebody has since edited.
