/**
 * Gross to net. This function is the module; everything else is plumbing.
 *
 * Pure — no Prisma, no Express, **and no currency**. One employee has exactly
 * one payment currency, so no payslip ever needs mixed-currency addition, and
 * conversion happens once on the totals outside this function. Converting per
 * line and summing gives a total that disagrees with the converted total, and
 * then the payslip's own lines would not add up.
 *
 * Rounding happens once per line and once per total, and every total is a sum
 * of already-rounded lines — never a rounded sum of unrounded ones. The
 * alternative is the single most reported payroll bug and the least
 * defensible: a document whose visible lines do not add up to its own total.
