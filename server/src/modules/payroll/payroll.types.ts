/**

 * Every money field in a `breakdown` is a **string**, not a number. `Decimal`

 * unrounded value would land in the Json column with more decimals than every
 * other line beside it. Formatting through `toMoneyString` is what keeps the
 * stored document internally consistent, and it is why these are typed as
 * strings rather than as `Money`: the type stops a raw Decimal being written.
